Notes on install Linux on the AMD [Personal Internet Communicator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_Internet_Communicator) (PIC).

The PIC was shipped with a locked-down BIOS which prevented the installation of any other operating system.  Fortunately, someone created a hacked BIOS which circumvents this.
